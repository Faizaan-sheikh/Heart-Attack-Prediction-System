# Heart-Attack-Prediction-System

This project is a Python-based machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using a Tkinter GUI for user interaction. It processes health parameters and predicts the risk with a user-friendly interface.

Features:

	•	Graphical User Interface: Built with Tkinter to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to input health data and receive predictions.
	•	Data preprocessing: Cleans and scales the dataset for accurate predictions.
	•	Modeling: Implements models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
	•	Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	•	Visualization: Displays insights with confusion matrices and feature importance charts.

Tech Stack:

	•	Python
	•	Tkinter (for GUI)
	•	Pandas
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	Matplotlib/Seaborn
